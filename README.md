# Py-CGAD

Python Class for Github Application Development (Py-CGAD). This class is 
designed to simplify the process of creating a python github application. The
class provides an abstraction to several RESTful API calls, it also simplifies
the number of steps required to authenticate your application.

For an example of how to setup an application one is provided [here](https://github.com/JoshuaSBrown/PyCGADExample).
This simple status reporting app uses Py-CGAD to simply upload a status check to 
a provided commit. In structions for how to setup a custom app are provided in 
the Py-CGAD wiki.
